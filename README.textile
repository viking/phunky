h2. Phunky

Phunky is Haml parser written in PHP.  It's purpose is to be as close to the
Ruby Haml parser as possible.  Just about all of the
"Haml specification":http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com is covered.  See below for a
list of differences.

h3. Differences

Unsupported modifiers:
* < and >
* ~
* !!!
* |
* [] (I'm not sure this one is even possible in PHP)

Filters don't do string interpolation.  Use PHP tags instead.  Ex:
<pre>
:plain
  foo
  <?php echo 'bar!' ?>
</pre>

User filters are implemented via functions instead of classes.  The
user-defined function should accept one argument (the filter text).

h3. Bundled filters

* plain
* javascript

h3. Caveats


h3. Example use

<pre>
<?php
require 'phunky.php';

$p = new Phunky($argv[1]);
$template = $p->compile();

$out = fopen("template.php", "w");
fwrite($out, $template);
fclose($out);

echo "========== template ==========\n";
echo $template;
echo "=========== result ===========\n";
require 'template.php';
?>
</pre>
